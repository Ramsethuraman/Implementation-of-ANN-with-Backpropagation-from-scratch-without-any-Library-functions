# Implementation-of-ANN-with-Backpropagation-from-scratch-without-any-Library-functions
This is a program which implements ANN from the scratch which includes the process of forward propagation with Sigmoid activation function and followed by back propagation and correcting the error after each iteration. We run it for n iterations and we get an approximate accuracy of 90% with Seeds Dataset
